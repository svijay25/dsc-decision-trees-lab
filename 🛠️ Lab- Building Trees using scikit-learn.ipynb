    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the simple example you saw in the previous lesson, you'll now build a decision tree for a more complex dataset. This lab covers all major areas of standard machine learning practice, from data acquisition to evaluation of results. We'll continue to use the Scikit-learn and Pandas libraries to conduct this analysis, following the same structure we saw in the previous lesson.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use scikit-learn to fit a decision tree classification model \n",
    "- Use entropy and information gain to identify the best attribute to split on at each node \n",
    "- Plot a decision tree using Python "

    "In this lab, you'll work with a popular dataset for classification called the \"UCI Bank note authentication dataset\". This data was extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknotes! The notes were first digitized, followed by a numerical transformation using DSP techniques. The final set of engineered features are all continuous in nature, meaning that our dataset consists entirely of floats, with no strings to worry about. If you're curious about how the dataset was created, you can visit the UCI link [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)!\n",
